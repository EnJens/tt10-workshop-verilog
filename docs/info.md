## How it works

It takes the input clock (10Mhz), subdivides it into 1Hz clock and
either counts up or down on the 7 segment display.

It wraps around when reaching the max value.

The value of the first dipswitch decides whether it counts up or down.
Reset sets the value back to 0.

## How to testWWx½x½

Power it up and observe 7 segment display behaviour.

## External hardware
